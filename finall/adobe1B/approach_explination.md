# Approach Explanation for Round 1B

## Overview
Our persona-driven document intelligence system processes structured document outlines from Round 1A to identify and rank the most relevant sections for specific user personas and tasks. By leveraging the hierarchical structure already extracted from PDFs, we focus on intelligent semantic matching and contextual relevance scoring.

## Technical Methodology

### Input Processing and Data Integration
The system seamlessly integrates with Round 1A outputs by parsing JSON files containing document titles and structured outlines with heading levels (H1, H2, H3) and page references. This approach eliminates redundant PDF processing while preserving the rich structural information needed for intelligent section ranking. We maintain document provenance by mapping JSON filenames to their corresponding PDF sources.

### Semantic Relevance Engine
Our core innovation lies in the multi-dimensional relevance scoring algorithm. The system combines semantic similarity analysis using spaCy's word embeddings with targeted keyword extraction and matching. Section titles are analyzed against persona descriptions and job requirements using both direct term matching and contextual understanding. We weight hierarchical importance, giving preference to higher-level headings that typically contain more significant organizational information.

### Contextual Intelligence and Refinement
Rather than relying solely on raw text extraction, our system generates contextually rich refined text by analyzing section titles in relation to document context and domain knowledge. This approach creates meaningful summaries that explain the relevance and content of each section, even when working with minimal structured data. The system incorporates domain-specific knowledge patterns to enhance understanding of content areas like methodology, ingredients, preparation techniques, and analytical findings.

### Adaptive Processing Strategy
The solution gracefully adapts to varying computational environments by implementing intelligent fallbacks. When advanced NLP models are available, it leverages semantic similarity for nuanced understanding. In resource-constrained scenarios, it maintains effectiveness through robust keyword-based analysis and structural heuristics.

## Innovation and Impact
This solution transforms static document structures into dynamic, query-responsive knowledge systems. By understanding both content semantics and user intent, it enables rapid identification of relevant information across document collections, significantly reducing research time while ensuring comprehensive coverage of pertinent sections for specific professional contexts and tasks.
